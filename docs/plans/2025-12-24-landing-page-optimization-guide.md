# High-Converting Landing Page Guide for Very Normal TTS

A comprehensive playbook for building a landing page that converts productivity and podcast enthusiasts into active users.

---

## Executive Summary

### The Five Non-Negotiables

After 15+ years optimizing B2C SaaS landing pages, these are the principles that consistently drive 3-5x conversion improvements:

1. **Clarity beats cleverness.** Your visitor should understand what you offer within 5 seconds. No jargon, no mystery, no "platform that leverages AI to optimize content consumption experiences." Say what it does.

2. **One page, one goal.** Every element either moves the visitor toward signup or creates friction. Remove anything that doesn't directly support the conversion goal.

3. **Specificity creates credibility.** "Listen to articles" is weak. "Turn that 15-minute article into a podcast episode you can hear on your morning run" is specific and vivid.

4. **Reduce cognitive load relentlessly.** Every choice, every field, every click costs you conversions. The signup flow should feel effortless.

5. **Address objections before they become barriers.** Visitors are silently asking "Will this work with my podcast app?" and "Is this actually free?" Answer these questions proactively.

### The TTS-Specific Conversion Thesis

Your ideal visitor has:
- 50+ articles saved in Pocket, Instapaper, or browser tabs
- Guilt about their unread reading list
- 2+ hours of "dead time" daily (commute, chores, exercise)
- An existing podcast habit

The conversion psychology: Transform guilt ("I should read more") into satisfaction ("I'm finally getting through my reading list") through a tool that fits their existing behavior (podcasts).

## Core Landing Page Principles for B2C SaaS

### Principle 1: The 5-Second Test

Peep Laja's research at CXL Institute shows visitors decide whether to stay or leave in approximately 5 seconds. In that window, your page must communicate:

- **What** this is
- **Who** it's for
- **Why** they should care

**Test your page:** Show it to someone for 5 seconds, then ask: "What does this product do? Who is it for?" If they can't answer correctly, your messaging is broken.

### Principle 2: One Primary CTA

Oli Gardner's "Attention Ratio" principle: The ratio of links to conversion goals should be 1:1. Every additional link, navigation item, or alternative action dilutes focus.

**For this landing page:**
- Remove top navigation (or minimize to logo only)
- Single primary CTA: "Start Listening Free"
- Footer links only for legal requirements

### Principle 3: Message Match

Joanna Wiebe's core copywriting principle: The words on your landing page must match the words in the visitor's head.

**Your visitors are thinking:**
- "I have so many articles saved that I'll never read"
- "I wish I could listen to articles like podcasts"
- "My commute/chores time feels wasted"

**Mirror this language exactly.**

### Principle 4: The Grunt Test

Can a caveman look at your page and grunt: "What this? What do for me? What do next?"

- **What this?** → A tool that turns articles into podcast episodes
- **What do for me?** → Listen to your reading list while doing other things
- **What do next?** → Click "Start Listening Free"

### Principle 5: Friction Logging

Every form field, every click, every moment of confusion is friction. For each element, ask: "Is this absolutely necessary for signup?" If not, remove it or defer it to post-signup.

**Friction audit for signup flow:**
- Name field? → Defer (can ask later)
- Email? → Required
- Password? → Consider magic link or OAuth only
- Credit card? → No (freemium model)
- Onboarding quiz? → Defer to post-signup

## Section-by-Section Breakdown

### 1. Hero Section

**Purpose:** Communicate value proposition, capture attention, drive first action.

**Time budget:** You have 2-3 seconds of visual scanning before the visitor decides to scroll or leave.

#### Headline Formula

Use the **"[Outcome] + [Method]"** structure:

```
Finally listen to [your reading list / those saved articles]
Turn any article into a podcast episode in your feed
```

**Alternative formulas:**

**"Do X without Y" (Problem Elimination):**
```
Get through your reading list without finding time to read
```

**"For [audience] who [struggle]" (Identity + Pain):**
```
For people with 100 saved articles they'll never read
```

**"What if you could [dream outcome]?" (Possibility):**
```
What if your unread articles became a podcast you actually listen to?
```

#### Subheadline

Expand on the headline with mechanism and ease:

```
Paste a URL, upload a file, or drop in text.
We'll turn it into audio and add it to your personal podcast feed.
Listen in Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or any podcast app.
```

Key elements:
- Three input methods (flexibility)
- The mechanism (personal podcast feed)
- Familiar tools (existing podcast apps)

#### Primary CTA

**Button text options (test these):**
- "Start Listening Free" (outcome-focused, low commitment)
- "Create Your Feed" (action-focused, implies ownership)
- "Try It Free" (simple, proven performer)

**Button design:**
- High contrast with background
- Larger than feels "right" (err on the side of too big)
- Ample white space around the button
- No competing visual elements nearby

#### Supporting Elements

**Trust indicators (pick 2-3):**
- "Free forever for up to X episodes/month"
- "No credit card required"
- "Works with any podcast app"
- "Setup in 60 seconds"

**Avoid in hero:**
- Long explanations
- Multiple CTAs
- Navigation links that distract
- Autoplay video or audio

### 2. Problem/Agitation Section

**Purpose:** Make visitors feel understood. Surface the pain they're experiencing so they're primed for your solution.

**Psychological principle:** People are more motivated to avoid pain than to seek pleasure. Agitate the problem before presenting the solution.

#### Problem Statement Framework

**Pattern: "You're not alone in this struggle"**

```
Sound familiar?

□ You've got 200 articles saved in Pocket that you'll "definitely read later"
□ Your browser has 47 tabs you're keeping "for reference"
□ Newsletters pile up faster than you can open them
□ You keep saving articles but never find time to actually read them
```

**Why checkboxes work:** They create micro-interactions and let visitors self-identify with specific pain points.

#### Agitation Copy

**Twist the knife gently:**

```
Meanwhile, you've got hours of "dead time" every day.

Commuting. Doing dishes. Folding laundry. Walking the dog.
Time your eyes are busy but your ears are free.

What if all those saved articles could become
episodes in a podcast you actually listen to?
```

**Key elements:**
- Acknowledge the wasted opportunity (dead time)
- List specific scenarios (commute, dishes, laundry, dog walks)
- Bridge to the possibility

#### Emotional Resonance

**Target emotions:**
- Guilt (about the unread pile)
- Frustration (never enough time)
- Hope (there might be a solution)

**Avoid:**
- Shame or judgment
- Exaggeration of the problem
- Problems your product can't actually solve

### 3. Solution/Benefits Section

**Purpose:** Present your product as the bridge from problem to desired outcome.

#### The "Before/After Bridge" Framework

**Before:** Guilt-inducing pile of unread articles
**After:** Actually getting through your reading list
**Bridge:** Your personal podcast feed

```
Your personal reading podcast

Drop in any article, blog post, or newsletter.
We'll convert it to audio and add it to your podcast feed.
Listen in the app you already use, during time you'd otherwise waste.

Finally, a reason to feel good about that reading list.
```

#### Benefit-Focused Copy (Not Feature-Focused)

**Wrong (feature-focused):**
- "AI-powered text-to-speech"
- "RSS feed generation"
- "Multiple input formats supported"

**Right (benefit-focused):**
- "Listen to articles in natural-sounding voices"
- "Episodes appear in your podcast app automatically"
- "Works with URLs, files, or copy-paste text"

**The transformation:**
- Feature: "Text-to-speech conversion"
- Advantage: "Turns written content into audio"
- Benefit: "Get through your reading list while doing other things"

#### Three Benefits to Emphasize

**1. Works with what you already use**
```
No new app to download. No new habit to build.
Episodes show up in Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Overcast,
or whatever app you already listen in.
```

**2. Dead time becomes productive**
```
Your commute, workout, and chores become
opportunities to learn and stay informed.
```

**3. Finally make progress on that reading list**
```
Those saved articles? You'll actually get through them.
The guilt disappears when you're listening to one every day.
```

#### Visual Treatment

Pair each benefit with an icon or illustration:
- Podcast app logos (Apple Podcasts, Spotify, etc.)
- Headphones + person doing activity
- Progress indicator / checkmarks

### 4. How It Works Section

**Purpose:** Reduce uncertainty by showing the exact process. Simple = more signups.

#### The 3-Step Framework

Optimal for landing pages. Four or more steps feels complex.

```
How it works

1. Add your content
   Paste a URL, upload a file, or copy-paste text.
   We handle articles, blog posts, newsletters, PDFs, and more.

2. We convert it to audio
   Natural-sounding voices turn your text into a podcast episode.
   Processing takes about a minute for most articles.

3. Listen in your podcast app
   Subscribe to your personal feed once.
   New episodes appear automatically, ready to play.
```

#### Visual Treatment Options

**Option A: Numbered steps with icons**
```
[1] → [2] → [3]
Add    Convert   Listen
```

**Option B: Screenshot/GIF progression**
Show the actual interface at each step

**Option C: Animated walkthrough**
A looping GIF or short video showing the full flow

**Recommendation:** Option B (screenshots) for clarity, with Option C (demo video) as a testing variant.

#### Reduce Perceived Complexity

- Emphasize speed: "Processing takes about a minute"
- Emphasize automation: "Episodes appear automatically"
- Emphasize familiarity: "in your podcast app"

### 5. Social Proof Section

**Purpose:** Transfer trust from existing users/entities to prospective users.

#### Types of Social Proof (Ranked by Impact)

1. **Testimonials from recognizable people** (highest impact)
2. **Specific user stories with details**
3. **Aggregate numbers** ("5,000+ articles converted")
4. **Integration logos** (podcast apps, trusted services)
5. **Media mentions** (if available)

#### For Early-Stage Products

When you don't have extensive testimonials, emphasize:

**1. Integration trust (borrow credibility):**
```
Works with the apps you already trust

[Apple Podcasts logo] [Spotify logo] [Overcast logo] [Pocket Casts logo]
```

**2. Specific, detailed testimonials:**
One specific, detailed testimonial beats ten generic ones.

**Weak:**
> "Great app! Love it!" - User

**Strong:**
> "I had 300 articles saved in Pocket. After two months using this, I've listened to over 100 of them during my morning runs. It's the only way I'm finally making progress." - Sarah, Product Manager

**3. User-generated metrics (when you have them):**
```
Join 2,500+ listeners who've converted 50,000+ articles
```

#### Testimonial Collection Strategy

**Questions to ask users:**
1. "What was your reading backlog situation before using this?"
2. "How has this changed your routine?"
3. "What specific content have you been able to get through?"
4. "Would you recommend this to a friend? Why?"

**Format for display:**
```
"[Specific outcome + emotional impact]"
— [Name], [Role/Context that adds credibility]
```

### 7. Final CTA Section

**Purpose:** Capture visitors who've scrolled the full page and are now convinced.

#### Psychology

Visitors at the bottom of the page are "hot leads." They've consumed your content and haven't bounced. Make the final CTA compelling and frictionless.

#### Copy Framework

**Restate the value proposition with urgency:**

```
Your reading list isn't going to listen to itself.

Start converting articles today.
No credit card. No commitment. No reason not to try.

[Start Listening Free]
```

**Alternative: Future pacing**

```
Imagine actually getting through your reading list.

A month from now, you could have listened to 30 articles
you'd otherwise never read.

[Create Your Free Feed]
```

#### Design Principles

- Full-width background for visual separation
- Large, high-contrast CTA button
- Minimal distractions
- Repeat key trust elements ("free," "no credit card")

### 8. Footer Section

**Purpose:** Provide necessary links without distracting from conversion.

#### Minimal Footer Contents

- Logo
- Legal links (Privacy, Terms)
- Contact/Support link
- Copyright

**Do not include:**
- Long lists of features
- Multiple CTAs
- Social media links (these leak traffic)
- Blog links (these belong in post-signup nurture)

## Copywriting Frameworks and Formulas

### Headline Formulas That Convert

**1. Specific Outcome + Specific Audience**
```
"For podcast listeners with too many saved articles"
"Turn your reading backlog into your daily commute podcast"
```

**2. Before/After Bridge**
```
"From 200 unread articles to a podcast you actually listen to"
```

**3. Problem → Solution in One Sentence**
```
"Never find time to read? Listen instead."
```

**4. "What if" Possibility**
```
"What if you could listen to every article you save?"
```

**5. Social Proof + Outcome**
```
"Join 3,000+ people who finally get through their reading list"
```

### Body Copy Frameworks

**PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution):**
1. **Problem:** Identify the pain
2. **Agitate:** Twist the knife (consequences, wasted time)
3. **Solution:** Present your product as the answer

**AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action):**
1. **Attention:** Hook with headline
2. **Interest:** Explain the concept
3. **Desire:** Paint the outcome
4. **Action:** CTA

**4 Ps (Picture-Promise-Prove-Push):**
1. **Picture:** Describe the ideal outcome
2. **Promise:** What you'll deliver
3. **Prove:** Evidence it works
4. **Push:** CTA with urgency

### Microcopy That Converts

**CTA buttons:**
- "Start Listening Free" (outcome + low risk)
- "Create Your Feed" (action + ownership)
- "Get Started" (simple, proven)

**Trust indicators:**
- "Free forever for basic use"
- "No credit card required"
- "Cancel anytime"
- "Setup in 60 seconds"
- "Works with any podcast app"

**Error states:**
- "Hmm, that doesn't look like a valid email. Try again?"
- "Something went wrong on our end. Mind trying once more?"

**Success states:**
- "Welcome! Your feed is ready."
- "Episode queued—it'll appear in your podcast app shortly."

### Words to Use

**Power words for this audience:**
- Finally (implies long-awaited solution)
- Actually (implies previous failures)
- Automatic/Automatically (implies no effort)
- Personal (implies customization/privacy)
- Listen/Listening (key action word)
- Free (always high-converting)

### Words to Avoid

- Platform
- Leverage
- Solution (as a noun)
- Revolutionary
- Game-changing
- Cutting-edge
- AI-powered (unless necessary—it's overused)
- Seamlessly (cliché)

---

## Visual Hierarchy and Design

### The F-Pattern

Eye-tracking studies show users scan in an F-pattern:
1. Horizontal movement across top
2. Second horizontal movement lower
3. Vertical movement down the left side

**Implications:**
- Headline at top (captured in first horizontal scan)
- Key benefit in subheadline (captured in second scan)
- CTAs aligned left or center (captured in vertical scan)

### Visual Weight Hierarchy

**1. Headlines** (largest, boldest)
**2. CTAs** (high contrast, "pop" from page)
**3. Subheadlines/Section headers** (medium weight)
**4. Body copy** (regular weight, easy to read)
**5. Supporting text** (lighter weight, smaller size)

### Color Psychology

**Primary CTA color:** High contrast with background
- Recommendation: Bright, saturated color (green, orange, or blue depending on brand)
- Avoid: Red (associated with errors), muted colors

**Background:** Clean, minimal
- White or very light gray for content sections
- Slightly darker for final CTA section (visual separation)

### Whitespace

More whitespace = more perceived value.

- Generous margins around CTAs
- Breathing room between sections
- Don't crowd testimonials or benefits

### Typography

- Sans-serif for body (Inter, SF Pro, Open Sans)
- 16px minimum for body text
- 1.5-1.7 line height for readability
- Left-aligned body text (not justified)

### Imagery Guidelines

**Do:**
- Show the product interface (screenshots)
- Show outcomes (person listening while running)
- Use icons to break up text

**Don't:**
- Generic stock photos of people at laptops
- Abstract shapes with no meaning
- Images that don't relate to the product

---

## Mobile Optimization

### Mobile-First Principles

58%+ of web traffic is mobile. Design for mobile first, then expand to desktop.

#### Touch Targets

- Minimum 44x44px for tappable elements (Apple HIG)
- Adequate spacing between touch targets
- CTA buttons should span full width or near-full width on mobile

#### Content Prioritization

Mobile scrolls are cheap; confusion is expensive. Prioritize clarity over brevity.

**Mobile content order:**
1. Headline + subheadline
2. Primary CTA
3. Trust indicators
4. Product visual
5. Problem section
6. Solution/benefits
7. How it works
8. Social proof
9. FAQ
10. Final CTA

#### Form Optimization for Mobile

- Use appropriate input types (`type="email"` triggers email keyboard)
- Single-column layout
- Large, high-contrast submit buttons
- Show progress if multi-step

#### Mobile-Specific Considerations

- Sticky CTA bar at bottom (test this)
- Collapsible FAQ sections (accordions)
- Lazy-load images below the fold
- Test on actual devices, not just simulators

### Responsive Breakpoints

```css
/* Mobile first */
body { }

/* Tablet */
@media (min-width: 768px) { }

/* Desktop */
@media (min-width: 1024px) { }

/* Large desktop */
@media (min-width: 1440px) { }
```

## Conversion Rate Optimization

### Signup Flow Optimization

**Current best practice for B2C SaaS:**

1. **Email-only signup** (name and password can come later)
2. **Social auth options** (Google, Apple if relevant)
3. **Magic link option** (passwordless)
4. **No credit card for free tier** (ever)

**Signup form principles:**
- Single field visible (email)
- Autofocus on the email field
- Clear error messages
- Immediate feedback on success

### A/B Testing Recommendations

**High-impact tests (run these first):**

1. **Headline variants**
   - Outcome-focused vs. problem-focused
   - Specific vs. broad

2. **CTA button text**
   - "Start Listening Free" vs. "Create Your Feed" vs. "Try It Free"

3. **CTA button color**
   - High-contrast variants

4. **Hero image**
   - Product screenshot vs. lifestyle image vs. no image

5. **Social proof placement**
   - Above the fold vs. after benefits section

**Medium-impact tests:**

6. **Subheadline copy**
7. **Trust indicator selection**
8. **Number of benefits shown**
9. **FAQ open/closed by default**

**Testing principles:**
- Test one variable at a time
- Run tests to statistical significance
- Document results and learnings
- Don't test on low traffic (wait for volume)

### Analytics to Track

**Core metrics:**
- Visitor → Signup conversion rate
- Time on page
- Scroll depth
- CTA click-through rate

**Segment by:**
- Traffic source (organic, referral, direct)
- Device (mobile, desktop)
- First visit vs. return visit

**Heatmapping:**
Use Hotjar, FullStory, or similar to see:
- Where users click
- How far they scroll
- Where they drop off
