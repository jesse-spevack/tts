# Marketing & Traffic Strategy for Very Normal TTS

## Context

The landing page at tts.verynormal.dev has zero traffic. Before optimizing for conversion, we need visitors. This plan focuses on organic traffic acquisition with time investment only (no paid ads).

## Key Decisions Made

- **Domain**: Keep `tts.verynormal.dev` for now. Upgrade later if product gains traction.
- **Blog location**: Use existing blog at verynormal.info, link to the app. No need to build new blog infrastructure.
- **Investment**: Time only, no budget for ads.

## Content Strategy

Write blog posts on verynormal.info that drive traffic to the app. Four content types, prioritized:

### 1. Personal Story + Problem-Focused (Start Here)

**Recommended first post** - combine these two angles into one launch post.

**Example title**: "I Built a Tool Because I'll Never Read My 200 Saved Articles"

**Why start here**:
- Emotionally resonant - many people have this problem
- Shareable on Hacker News, Reddit, Indie Hackers
- Personal angle makes it authentic and harder to ignore
- One-time effort, high potential impact

**Distribution**:
- Post on verynormal.info
- Submit to Hacker News (Show HN)
- Post on r/productivity, r/podcasting, r/SideProject
- Share on Indie Hackers
- Cross-post to dev.to with canonical link

### 2. SEO/How-To Content (Layer In Next)

**Example titles**:
- "How to Listen to Articles as a Podcast"
- "Convert Any Newsletter to Audio"
- "Turn Blog Posts into Podcast Episodes"

**Why**:
- Targets search queries from people actively looking for solutions
- Slow burn but compounds over time
- Evergreen content that keeps working

**Approach**:
- Research keywords with free tools (Google Search Console, Ubersuggest free tier)
- Write 1-2 posts per month targeting specific queries
- Include clear CTA linking to the app

### 3. Build in Public (Ongoing)

**Format**: Regular posts about building the product.

**Topics**:
- Technical decisions and trade-offs
- User feedback and how you responded
- Metrics and milestones (when you have them)
- Lessons learned

**Why**:
- Builds audience over time
- Creates ongoing touchpoints
- Developer community loves this content
- Low pressure - just share what you're doing

**Cadence**: 1-2 posts per month, or when something interesting happens.

### 4. Community Engagement (Parallel Track)

Not blog content, but important for traffic:

- **Reddit**: Engage authentically in r/productivity, r/podcasting, r/newsletters. Help people, mention tool when relevant (not spammy).
- **Hacker News**: Comment on related threads about reading habits, podcasts, TTS.
- **Twitter/X**: Share snippets, engage with productivity/podcast community.

## Success Metrics

Since analytics are now in place:

- **Week 1-2**: Any traffic at all (baseline)
- **Month 1**: 100+ unique visitors
- **Month 2-3**: First sign-ups from organic traffic
- **Ongoing**: Track which posts/channels drive the most traffic

## Next Actions

1. Write the first post (personal story + problem-focused)
2. Prepare distribution list (HN, Reddit subs, Indie Hackers)
3. Publish and distribute on same day
4. Monitor analytics for 1-2 weeks
5. Write first SEO-focused post based on what you learn

## Open Questions

- What specific Reddit communities beyond r/productivity and r/podcasting might be relevant?
- Any existing connections in the podcast/productivity space who might share?
- Is there a specific angle or hook for the personal story that feels most authentic?
