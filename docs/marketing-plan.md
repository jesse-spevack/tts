# Very Normal TTS Marketing Plan

## Overview

This marketing plan focuses on organic growth through authentic content and strategic community engagement. The core message: "Finally listen to your reading list" resonates with people who accumulate articles they never read. We'll reach these audiences through blog posts, Twitter engagement, and Reddit community participation.

## Target Audiences

### Primary
- **Tab Hoarders**: People with 50+ browser tabs of articles they mean to read
- **Commuters & Runners**: Those with long commutes or regular exercise routines looking for content
- **Indie Hackers**: Builders who want to consume more technical content but lack reading time
- **Newsletter Subscribers**: People subscribed to many newsletters they struggle to keep up with

### Secondary
- **Academic Researchers**: Need to consume large volumes of papers and articles
- **Content Curators**: People who share and discuss articles professionally
- **Accessibility Users**: Those who prefer or require audio content

## Content Strategy: Blog Posts

### Launch Series (4 Posts)

#### 1. "I Built a Tool to Finally Clear My Browser Tabs"
**Platform**: Personal blog, then cross-post to Dev.to, Hashnode
**Goal**: Share the origin story and problem validation
**Key Points**:
- The pain: 73 open tabs, none getting read
- Hours of commute time wasted on nothing
- Building a solution for yourself first
- Unexpected side benefit: actually enjoying long-form content again
**CTA**: "Try it free - 2 episodes/month, no credit card"

#### 2. "How Text-to-Speech Finally Stopped Sounding Robotic"
**Platform**: Medium, Dev.to
**Goal**: Address the #1 objection ("Does it sound robotic?")
**Key Points**:
- Evolution of TTS technology
- Google Cloud TTS vs older solutions
- Audio samples embedded
- Use cases: articles, newsletters, PDFs
**CTA**: "Hear the difference yourself" → sample page

#### 3. "The Stack: Rails 8, Hotwire, and $X/month in Cloud Costs"
**Platform**: Dev.to, Indie Hackers
**Goal**: Attract technical audience, show transparency
**Key Points**:
- Full stack breakdown (Rails 8, SQLite, Solid Queue)
- Why Hotwire for real-time updates
- Cost breakdown: Google Cloud TTS, Storage, Vertex AI
- Deployment with Kamal
- Lessons learned
**CTA**: "Built something similar? I'd love to hear about it"

#### 4. "Turning Your Instapaper Queue Into a Podcast Feed"
**Platform**: Personal blog, Hacker News (if appropriate)
**Goal**: Specific use case for read-it-later app users
**Key Points**:
- Export from Instapaper/Pocket
- Batch processing workflow
- Private RSS feed for consumption
- Comparison to audiobook services
**CTA**: "Start with your oldest saved article"

### Ongoing Content (1-2 per month)

**Use Case Spotlights**:
- "How I Listen to All My Substack Newsletters"

**Transparency Updates**:
- Monthly revenue/cost breakdowns
- User growth metrics
- Feature development roadmap based on feedback

## Twitter Strategy

### Profile Optimization
- **Bio**: "Finally listen to your reading list. Built by @jspevack | Rails • TTS • Indie Project"
- **Pinned Tweet**: Demo video showing URL → podcast flow (30 seconds max)
- **Handle**: Leverage @jspevack personal account initially, consider dedicated @verynormaltts account later

### Content Mix (3-5 tweets/week)

**Product Updates (40%)**:
- Feature announcements with screenshots/demos
- "Just shipped: [feature]" updates
- Bug fixes and improvements
- Voice samples and quality improvements

**Behind-the-Scenes (30%)**:
- Building in public updates
- Revenue/metrics transparency
- Technical challenges and solutions
- Customer feedback and feature requests

**Value Content (20%)**:
- Tips for managing reading lists

- Text-to-speech technology explainers
- Comparisons to alternatives (objective, not competitive)

**Engagement (10%)**:
- Responses to user feedback
- Sharing user success stories (with permission)
- Polls about feature priorities
- Questions to audience about their reading habits

### Twitter Thread Series

**"Reading List Strategies"** (weekly):
- Thread 1: "How I went from 73 open tabs to inbox zero"
- Thread 2: "The best newsletters to listen to (not read)"
- Thread 3: "Why audiobooks ≠ article-to-audio"
- Thread 4: "5 podcast apps that handle custom RSS feeds best"

**Technical Threads** (bi-weekly):
- "Building with Rails 8: What's actually different"
- "Why I chose SQLite over Postgres for this app"
- "The real cost of running a TTS app"

### Strategic Engagement

**Daily Actions**:
- Search "too many tabs" → reply with empathy + value (not spammy)
- Search "reading list" OR "to read" → engage authentically
- Search "listen to articles" OR "text to speech" → provide helpful context
- Monitor mentions of Instapaper, Pocket, read-it-later apps

**Communities to Engage**:
- #BuildInPublic tweets
- #IndieHackers discussions
- #Rails and #RubyOnRails community
- Productivity/PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) community

**Influencer Outreach**:
- DM 10-15 relevant creators offering free unlimited tier for authentic review
- Target: productivity creators, indie hackers, Rails developers
- No ask beyond "would love your feedback if you try it"

## Reddit Strategy

### Target Subreddits

**Primary Engagement**:
- r/productivity (1.2M members) - Weekly participation
- r/SideProject (200K members) - Launch post + updates
- r/rails (60K members) - Technical discussion posts
- r/podcasts (2.5M members) - Use case discussions

**Secondary Engagement**:
- r/programming (6M members) - Technical deep-dive posts only
- r/Entrepreneur (3M members) - Building in public updates

- r/opensource (90K members) - If/when open sourcing parts

**Niche Communities**:
- r/academia - Academic paper to audio use case
- r/running - Content for runs
- r/InstaPaper & r/Pocket - Direct user base overlap

### Engagement Rules

**What Works**:
- Genuine participation in discussions before posting about project
- Leading with the problem, not the solution
- Sharing actual usage statistics and learnings
- Asking for feedback on specific features
- Being transparent about being the creator

**What Doesn't**:
- Cold posting "I made a thing" without community history
- Only showing up to promote
- Generic "check out my app" posts
- Ignoring subreddit rules about self-promotion

### Reddit Post Calendar

### Reddit AMA Consideration

**Timing**: After 500+ users or $1K+ MRR
**Subreddit**: r/Entrepreneur or r/SideProject
**Topic**: "I built a TTS app that makes $X/month - AMA about building in public"
**Preparation**: Have usage stats, cost breakdown, technical challenges ready

## Community Building

**Encourage sharing**:
- "Share your favorite article you've converted" prompts

- Before/after: "tab count" posts
- Testimonial collection (with incentive: free month)

**Make it Easy**:
- Pre-written tweet templates with episode share

- Don't copy-paste same message across platforms
- Genuine engagement > volume

**Ignoring Negative Feedback**:
- Respond to criticism professionally
- Use feedback for product improvements
- Show you're listening with "shipped based on feedback" updates

**Burnout**:

- Use scheduling tools for consistency
- It's okay to take a week off from social
