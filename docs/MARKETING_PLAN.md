Subject: Turn your articles into a podcast feed?

Hey [Name],

I built a tool that solves a problem I bet you have: too many saved articles, not enough time to read them.

Very Normal TTS converts any article into a podcast episode that shows up in your existing podcast app. Paste a URL, get audio in your feed.

Would love to give you free unlimited access to try it. If you dig it, maybe worth mentioning to your audience?

No pressure either way - just thought you'd appreciate it.

3. **Personal/indie** - Not a faceless corporation
4. **One thing done well** - Not trying to be everything

### Positioning Statement
> "Very Normal TTS is the simplest way to turn any article into a podcast episode in your existing podcast app. Unlike read-later apps with bolted-on audio, we're built from the ground up for listening."
