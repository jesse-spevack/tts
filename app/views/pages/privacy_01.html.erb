    <p>
      PodRead ("<strong>PodRead</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>,"
      or "<strong>our</strong>") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal
      information. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, store, and protect
      information when you use podread.app and related services (collectively, the
      "<strong>Services</strong>").
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe privacy policies should be readable by humans, not just lawyers. So here it is, in plain language.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We collect information you provide directly when you use PodRead:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account information:</strong> Your email address when you sign up.</li>
      <li><strong>Content you submit:</strong> URLs, pasted text, and uploaded files that you send to PodRead for conversion into audio.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment information:</strong> If you subscribe to a paid plan, payment details are collected and processed by Stripe. We do not store your credit card number.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Basic analytics about how you use the service, such as episodes created, pages visited, and feature usage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, maintain, and improve PodRead</li>
      <li>Convert your submitted content into audio episodes</li>
      <li>Deliver episodes to your private podcast feed</li>
      <li>Process payments and manage your subscription</li>
      <li>Send you service-related emails (account confirmations, billing receipts, important updates)</li>
      <li>Respond to your support requests</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information. We do <strong>not</strong> use your submitted content to train AI models. Your articles are yours.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      PodRead uses the following third-party services to operate:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Cloud Text-to-Speech:</strong> To convert your articles into audio. Article text is sent to Google Cloud for processing.</li>
      <li><strong>Stripe:</strong> To process payments securely. Stripe handles all payment data.</li>
      <li><strong>Resend:</strong> To send transactional emails (account confirmations, receipts).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each of these providers has their own privacy policy. We only share the minimum information needed for them to provide their services.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      We retain your account information and generated audio episodes for as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we will delete your personal data and audio files within 30 days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Submitted article text is processed for conversion and is not retained after your episode is generated.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      We use essential cookies to keep you logged in and to remember your preferences. We do not use third-party advertising or tracking cookies.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>
      You can delete your account at any time, which will remove your personal data and generated episodes. You can also contact us to request a copy of your data or ask questions about what we store.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect your information, including encryption in transit and at rest. However, no system is perfectly secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the
      "<strong>Last updated</strong>" date at the top of this page. Continued use of PodRead after changes
      indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
