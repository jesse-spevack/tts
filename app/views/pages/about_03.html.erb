But I spend hours every week running, doing chores, and driving. That time was going to waste.</p><p>So I built PodRead. Paste a URL, and it extracts the article, converts it to natural-sounding audio, and delivers it as a podcast episode to your private feed. No apps to install. Just open your podcast player and listen.</p><p>PodRead is bootstrapped and independent. No VC funding, no investors, no board of directors. Just one developer in Denver building a tool that solves a real problem. The goal is simple: help people get through their reading list by turning it into something they can listen to.</p>'.html_safe
