# Icon Requirements

This directory should contain PNG icons for the Chrome extension in the following sizes:

## Required Files

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 pixels (favicon, toolbar)
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extensions page)
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store, installation)

## Guidelines

- Use PNG format with transparency support
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use consistent branding with the TTS Podcast application
- Recommended: Create a microphone or podcast-themed icon

## Placeholder Status

These icons need to be created before the extension can be loaded in Chrome.
You can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files as placeholders during development.
