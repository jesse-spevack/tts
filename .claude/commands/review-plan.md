# Review Implementation Plan

You are reviewing an implementation plan with the user step-by-step.

## Your Task

Go through the plan one step at a time:

1. **Find the plan file** in `docs/plans/` (use the most recent if multiple exist)
2. **Read the entire plan** to understand the full scope
3. **Start step-by-step review**:
   - Present each step with a **one-sentence explanation**
   - Wait for user response:
     - **"C"** = continue to next step
     - **Question** = answer it, then re-present the same step
     - **"update [instructions]"** = modify the plan as requested
4. **Track progress** - remember which step you're on
5. **Handle updates**:
   - When user requests changes, update the plan file immediately
   - Show what you changed
   - Continue from that step

## Review Format

For each step, say:

**Task [N], Step [M]:** [One sentence explaining what this step does]

Then wait for: question, "C", or update request.

## Update Handling

When user says to update/change something:

1. Make the edit to the plan file
2. Confirm: "Updated! [brief description of change]"
3. Continue from that step

## Important Rules

- **One step at a time** - never skip ahead
- **One sentence** per step explanation - be concise
- **Wait for response** after each step
- **Track where you are** in the plan
- **Update immediately** when requested
- **Continue from the same step** after updates

## If User Has Concerns

If user says things like:
- "This seems like a lot of work before seeing results"
- "Can we restructure this?"
- "This feels wrong"

**Stop and discuss**:
1. Ask what they want to achieve first
2. Propose restructuring the plan
3. Get agreement before updating
4. Rewrite plan if needed
