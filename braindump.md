# Misc items to brainstorm plans / implementation for

- [ ] Harden magic link system, we should require re-login once a month. 
- [ ] Lint JS controllers
- [ ] env for development in hub
- [ ] Unique error IDs for support tickets (e.g., ERR-2024-ABC123 for easier debugging)
- [ ] Add TTL to MP3s in GCS (retention policy for cost management)
- [ ] Update the landing page design 
- [ ] Consolidate mocking libraries (both Minitest::Mock and Mocktail in use)
- [ ] Unlimited users should get better LLM model
- [ ] Audit codebase for unused method arguments (RuboCop doesn't catch args stored but never read)
- [ ] Consider using Gemini 2.0 Flash for free tier (cheaper, 8k output limit works for 15k char input)
