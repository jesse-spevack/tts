# Misc items to brainstorm plans / implementation for

- [ ] Logging audit - we should have just enough logging to make debugging simple.
    - Log inspection commands must be documented in a runbook
- [ ] We need to completely re-design the layout and UX of the hub
- [ ] We need realtime updates of the status, not just on page reload
- [ ] Harden magic link system, we should require re-login once a month.
