# Welcome to Very Normal Podcast

This podcast features readings of long-form blog posts and articles from around the web, automatically converted to audio using Google's text-to-speech technology.

Each episode takes written content that I've discovered and found interesting, but would prefer to listen to rather than read, and transforms it into spoken audio. This makes it easy to consume thoughtful long-form writing while commuting, exercising, or doing other activities.

The content varies based on what catches my attentionâ€”typically in-depth articles about technology, systems, and interesting perspectives on how things work. You'll also find episodes from my own blog, verynormal.info, where I post my thoughts on software engineering and related topics.

This is an experiment in making written content more accessible through automation.

Thanks for listening!
