# Pixel 10 brings telephoto to the masses for $799

The Google Pixel 10 delivers the most significant base-model upgrade in the Pixel lineup's history by adding a telephoto camera while maintaining the $799 price point. Released in August 2025, the Pixel 10 series improves on the year-old Pixel 9 lineup with a more powerful Tensor G5 chip, magnetic Qi2 charging, larger batteries, and brighter displays. However, the improvements aren't substantial enough to justify upgrading from a Pixel 9, and discounted Pixel 9 models may offer better value for budget-conscious buyers. Both generations feature identical four-model lineups (base, Pro, Pro XL, and Pro Fold), maintain seven years of software support, and share Google's signature computational photography prowess, though the Tensor processors still lag competitors in raw performance.

Google positioned the Pixel 9 series as a mature, refined smartphone lineup when it launched in August 2024, addressing long-standing battery life complaints and improving thermal management. The Pixel 10, arriving exactly one year later, builds on that foundation with focused improvements rather than revolutionary changes. The most dramatic shift occurs in the base model, which finally receives a telephoto lens previously reserved for Pro variants. This democratization of premium camera hardware at the $799 price point represents Google's most aggressive value proposition yet, though it comes with tradeoffs in megapixel counts for the main and ultrawide cameras.

## Four models per generation with identical pricing structure

Both the Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 lineups consist of four distinct models targeting different user segments. The Pixel 9/10 base models feature 6.3-inch displays and start at $799 for 128GB. The Pixel 9/10 Pro maintains the compact 6.3-inch size while adding pro-grade cameras and features at $999. The Pixel 9/10 Pro XL increases screen size to 6.8 inches with a larger 5,060 mAh (Pixel 9) or 5,200 mAh (Pixel 10) battery starting at $1,099-$1,199. The Pixel 9/10 Pro Fold represents Google's foldable offering with an 8-inch inner display starting at $1,799.

Storage configurations remain consistent across generations. The base Pixel 9 offered 128GB or 256GB, while Pixel 10 adds a new 512GB tier at $1,029. Pro models provide 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB options for both generations, with the Pixel 10 Pro XL eliminating the 128GB entry point. As of November 2025, retailers are offering substantial discounts on Pixel 9 models ranging from $150-$350 off, while early Black Friday promotions provide $150-$300 off Pixel 10 devices. These discounts make the value equation more complex than comparing list prices alone.

The Pixel 9 Pro Fold arrived in September 2024 at $1,799, while its Pixel 10 successor launched later in October 2025. Both Pro Fold models start at 256GB given their premium positioning. Google maintains price parity between generations at equivalent storage tiers, meaning buyers get more features for the same money with the Pixel 10—a rarity in today's smartphone market where most manufacturers increase prices annually.

## Telephoto camera transforms the base Pixel 10 experience

The most significant hardware difference between generations appears in the base model camera systems. The Pixel 9 features a dual-camera setup with a 50MP main wide (f/1.68, 1/1.31" sensor with OIS) and 48MP ultrawide (f/1.7, 123° field of view). It can achieve 2x optical-quality zoom through sensor cropping and up to 8x Super Res Zoom digitally, but lacks a dedicated telephoto lens. The Pixel 10 adopts a triple-camera configuration with a 48MP main wide (f/1.9), 13MP ultrawide (f/1.7), and a new 10.8MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom. This telephoto addition enables up to 20x Super Res Zoom and represents the first time a base-model Pixel has received this previously Pro-exclusive feature.

This camera strategy involves tradeoffs that reveal Google's priorities. The Pixel 10's main camera drops from 50MP to 48MP, and the ultrawide decreases dramatically from 48MP to 13MP. Yet real-world testing demonstrates these megapixel reductions don't translate to worse image quality. Android Authority noted that "the Pixel 10 Pro's photos are remarkably better despite no hardware changes," attributing improvements to the enhanced Image Signal Processor in the Tensor G5 chip. The Pixel 10 produces warmer, more accurate colors with better contrast and shadow handling. PhoneArena emphasized that the telephoto lens "dramatically improves zoom quality" compared to the Pixel 9's digital-only approach, making the Pixel 10 significantly more versatile for photography enthusiasts.

Both phones capture outstanding 1x photos with excellent dynamic range, accurate skin tones through Real Tone technology, and class-leading low-light performance via Night Sight. The 10.5MP front camera remains unchanged between generations on the base models. Video recording capabilities are similar, with both supporting 4K at 60fps, though the Pixel 10 defaults to 10-bit HDR for better color depth. The Pixel 10's improved optical image stabilization provides 2x the compensation range, yielding sharper handheld shots and smoother video. For users who rarely zoom beyond 2x, the Pixel 9's camera system remains excellent; for everyone else, the Pixel 10's telephoto lens justifies the upgrade.

Pro models maintain camera superiority across both generations. The Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL feature identical triple-camera systems: 50MP main wide, 48MP ultrawide, and 48MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom extending to 30x Super Res Zoom. They also include significantly upgraded 42MP front cameras (versus 10.5MP on base models). The Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL retain this same configuration but add Pro Res Zoom—an AI-enhanced digital zoom reaching 100x with improved clarity at extreme magnifications. Reviews indicate this feature can be overly aggressive with AI processing, sometimes producing uncanny results, but it's useful for situations requiring maximum reach.

The Pixel 9 Pro Fold features a different camera array optimized for its foldable form factor: 48MP main wide, 10.5MP ultrawide, and 10.8MP 5x telephoto. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold maintains this configuration but improves the main camera sensor and adds Instant View, a feature that displays photo previews on one half of the unfolded screen while the camera occupies the other half. Both Pro Fold models include dual front cameras (one on the outer display, one on the inner screen) at 10MP each.

## Display and design refinements favor Pixel 10 marginally

Both generations share nearly identical industrial design with flat edges, rounded corners, and Google's signature horizontal camera bar. The Pixel 10 measures 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.5mm and weighs 204g, making it imperceptibly thicker (0.1mm) and slightly heavier (6g) than the Pixel 9's 198g. Both use Gorilla Glass Victus 2 front and back with aluminum frames and carry IP68 water and dust resistance ratings. Tom's Guide praised both as having "one of the most flattering designs at its price point," though the similarities mean cases aren't cross-compatible despite minimal dimensional differences.

Display specifications remain functionally equivalent for the base models. Both feature 6.3-inch OLED panels with 2424 x 1080 resolution (422 PPI) and 60-120Hz adaptive refresh rates. The key difference lies in brightness: the Pixel 9 reaches 2,700 nits peak brightness, while the Pixel 10 achieves 3,000 nits. Independent testing measured the Pixel 10 at 2,330 nits versus the Pixel 9's 1,769 nits—a noticeable 32% improvement. However, Mark Ellis Reviews noted this difference is "marginally easier to see in bright conditions" and "frankly negligible for most users." Both displays deliver vibrant colors, deep blacks, and excellent viewing angles with HDR10+ support.

Pro models benefit from superior LTPO OLED "Super Actua" displays enabling 1-120Hz adaptive refresh for better power efficiency. The Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL reach 3,000 nits peak brightness at 495 PPI and 486 PPI respectively, while Pixel 10 Pro models increase to 3,300 nits. The Pro XL's 6.8-inch screen provides significantly more viewing area (2992 x 1344 resolution) compared to the compact 6.3-inch Pro models, making it ideal for media consumption and productivity.

The Pro Fold models showcase the most dramatic display differences. Both generations feature dual displays: a 6.3-6.4-inch outer OLED and a large 8-inch inner flexible OLED. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold slightly enlarges the outer display to 6.4 inches with reduced bezels while maintaining the industry-leading 8-inch inner screen. Both achieve 2,700-3,000 nits peak brightness. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold introduces a revolutionary gearless hinge rated for 10+ years of folding—twice as durable as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's mechanism. More significantly, it's the first foldable with full IP68 rating including dust protection, addressing a major durability concern in the foldable category.

Color options distinguish the generations aesthetically. Pixel 9 comes in Obsidian (black), Porcelain (off-white), Peony (pink), and Wintergreen. Pixel 10 offers Obsidian, Frost (white), Lemongrass (neon green), and Indigo (blue). Pro models feature more sophisticated colorways with matte glass backs instead of glossy finishes.

## Battery life improves incrementally with larger capacities

Battery capacity increases across the Pixel 10 lineup represent modest but meaningful improvements. The Pixel 9 base model houses a 4,700 mAh battery achieving 24+ hours of typical use according to Google, with Tom's Guide measuring 13 hours 18 minutes in continuous web browsing tests. The Pixel 10 upgrades to 4,970 mAh—a 270 mAh (6%) increase. Real-world testing shows the Pixel 10 lasting approximately 13 hours 13 minutes in similar tests, with Google claiming 30+ hours of typical use (a significant boost from the Pixel 9's 24+ hour claim). Both phones support Extreme Battery Saver mode extending longevity to 100+ hours when needed.

Charging speeds improve marginally. The Pixel 9 supports 27W wired charging reaching 55% in 30 minutes with a 45W adapter, while the Pixel 10 increases to 30W wired charging achieving 52% in 30 minutes. Wireless charging remains at 15W Qi-certified speeds for both base models, though the Pixel 10 adds Qi2 magnetic charging with Pixelsnap magnets built into the phone body. This MagSafe-compatible feature enables secure attachment of magnetic accessories including chargers, wallets, and mounts. However, users report alignment issues with some chargers not achieving full 15W speeds, and Qi2 certification doesn't guarantee full MagSafe compatibility.

Pro model batteries show similar incremental growth. The Pixel 9 Pro uses the same 4,700 mAh battery as the base model with 27W wired and 21W wireless charging. The Pixel 9 Pro XL steps up to 5,060 mAh with faster 37W wired and 23W wireless charging. The Pixel 10 Pro maintains a slightly smaller 4,870 mAh battery but adds 45W wired charging, while the Pixel 10 Pro XL increases to 5,200 mAh with 45W wired and 25W wireless charging—the fastest in the lineup. All Pro models support Qi2 magnetic charging on the Pixel 10 generation.

The Pro Fold models prioritize different engineering constraints. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold includes a 4,650 mAh battery with 45W wired charging, while the Pixel 10 Pro Fold substantially increases capacity to 5,015 mAh while maintaining 45W wired speeds. Both offer Qi wireless charging with the Pixel 10 adding magnetic alignment. Battery life testing on foldables proves challenging due to varying usage patterns between inner and outer screens, but both achieve Google's claimed 24-30+ hours with mixed use.

## Tensor G5 improves efficiency but still trails competitors

The Tensor G5 represents Google's most significant processor upgrade in the Pixel line, primarily because Google switched foundries from Samsung to TSMC for 3nm fabrication. This manufacturing change addresses the Tensor G4's thermal issues while delivering meaningful performance gains. Google claims the Tensor G5 achieves 34% faster CPU performance and 60% more powerful TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) for AI workloads compared to the Tensor G4 in the Pixel 9.

Geekbench 6 scores demonstrate real improvements. The Pixel 9's Tensor G4 achieved approximately 1,897 single-core and 3,721 multi-core scores. The Pixel 10's Tensor G5 jumps to 2,296 single-core (21% improvement) and 6,203 multi-core (46% improvement). GPU performance increases by 10-30% depending on workload. However, these gains still leave Tensor substantially behind flagship competitors. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with Snapdragon 8 Elite scores 2,867 single-core (+25% over Tensor G5) and 9,491 multi-core (+53% over Tensor G5). Apple's A18 Pro maintains an even larger performance lead.

Real-world performance reveals a more nuanced picture. PhoneArena confirmed "definite, undeniable gains in CPU tests," while Droid Life reported "no slowdowns or lag in everyday use" with the Pixel 10. However, 9to5Google noted "slight lag when inputting unlock codes, some apps load slower," and gaming remains problematic. Both Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 default to medium graphics settings in demanding games like Genshin Impact, achieving only 29 FPS at highest settings. The Pixel 10 shows some compatibility issues with newer games displaying black boxes. Android Police bluntly stated "The Google Pixel 10 isn't for you [enthusiasts]—deal with it," acknowledging Google's deliberate prioritization of AI capabilities over raw performance.

The Tensor G5's 60% more powerful TPU represents its true strength. The chip runs Gemini Nano 2.6x faster than Tensor G4, enabling full on-device processing of Google's large language models without cloud connectivity. This powers Pixel 10-exclusive features like Magic Cue (contextual information surfacing), Camera Coach (real-time photography guidance), and Voice Translate (real-time translation mimicking the user's voice). The Tensor G5 also dramatically improves thermal management—users report the Pixel 10 runs significantly cooler than the Pixel 9 during sustained workloads.

Both processors include the Titan M2 security coprocessor for hardware-level security. The Pixel 9's Tensor G4 features a Mali-G715 MP7 GPU, while the Pixel 10's Tensor G5 switches to a PowerVR DXT-48-1536 GPU—a significant architectural change addressing some thermal issues but not fully closing the performance gap with Qualcomm and Apple. RAM configurations provide 12GB LPDDR5X on Pixel 9 base models and 16GB on Pro variants, while Pixel 10 maintains the same allocation. Storage uses UFS 3.1 on Pixel 9 and upgrades to UFS 4.0 on higher-capacity Pixel 10 models for faster read/write speeds.

## Build quality maintains premium standards across both generations

Both the Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 demonstrate excellent build quality with premium materials and meticulous construction. Front and rear panels use Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2, offering improved drop protection and scratch resistance. Frames utilize recycled aluminum with different finishes: satin aluminum on base models, polished aluminum on Pro variants. The Pixel 10 markets its frame as "spacecraft-grade aluminum," though this appears primarily as branding rather than a substantial material difference.

IP68 dust and water resistance protects both generations, rated for submersion up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. This rating matches flagship competitors except for foldables, which traditionally offer only IPX8 (water resistance without dust protection). The Pixel 10 Pro Fold revolutionizes this category by achieving full IP68 certification including dust resistance—an industry first for foldable smartphones. This milestone addresses a critical durability concern that plagued earlier foldables, making the Pixel 10 Pro Fold significantly more practical for everyday use in varied environments.

The foldable hinge engineering showcases meaningful generational improvement. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold uses a fluid-friction design that opens fully flat, rated for years of regular use. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold introduces a gearless hinge rated for 10+ years of folding cycles—twice the durability of its predecessor. This simplified mechanism reduces potential failure points while maintaining smooth operation. At 10.8mm thick when folded, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is thicker than competitors like the Galaxy Z Fold 7 (8.9mm) but prioritizes durability and the IP68 rating over minimal thickness.

In-hand feel remains excellent for both generations. The flat edges provide secure grip, and weight distribution feels balanced. The glossy glass back on base Pixel 9/10 models attracts fingerprints more readily than the matte finish on Pro models, which offers superior grip and a more premium tactile experience. The camera bar protrudes approximately 2-3mm, causing the phone to rock when placed on flat surfaces—a design compromise consistent across the Pixel line since the Pixel 6.

## AI features showcase Google's software leadership

Google's AI capabilities represent the Pixel line's most distinctive advantage over competitors, with both generations offering class-leading computational photography and useful AI integrations. The Pixel 9 introduced expanded Gemini AI integration including features like Best Take (combining multiple shots for optimal expressions), Magic Editor (AI-powered photo editing with generative fill), Audio Magic Eraser (removing background noise from videos), and Circle to Search (searching anything on screen by circling it). These features work remarkably well and solve real user problems rather than serving as gimmicks.

The Pixel 10 builds on this foundation with several exclusive AI features leveraging the more powerful Tensor G5 TPU. Magic Cue represents contextual intelligence, proactively surfacing relevant information based on current activity—displaying flight details when calling an airline, showing addresses when texting location information, or pulling up reservation details when needed. It scans emails, messages, notes, and calendar data using on-device processing for privacy. However, it currently works only with Google services, limiting usefulness for users heavily invested in non-Google ecosystems.

Camera Coach provides real-time photography guidance powered by Gemini AI, offering suggestions for framing, lighting, and composition while shooting. This feature requires internet connectivity and has received mixed reviews—helpful for beginners but potentially intrusive for experienced photographers. Auto Best Take improves on the original by requiring only a single shot rather than multiple photos for face swapping. Voice Translate delivers real-time translation that mimics the user's voice characteristics, creating more natural-sounding conversations. Pro Res Zoom on Pixel 10 Pro models uses AI to enhance digital zoom up to 100x, though results become increasingly artificial beyond 30x.

Both generations benefit from Google's computational photography algorithms including Night Sight (exceptional low-light performance), Photo Unblur (sharpening blurry existing photos), Magic Eraser (removing unwanted objects), and Real Tone (accurate skin tone representation across diverse ethnicities). The Pixel 10's enhanced Image Signal Processor improves color accuracy, contrast, and shadow detail even when using the same camera hardware as Pixel 9 Pro models.

Google commits to seven years of OS updates, security patches, and Pixel Drops for both generations. Pixel 9 devices receive updates through 2031, while Pixel 10 extends through 2032. This industry-leading support timeline surpasses most Android manufacturers and matches Apple's iOS update cadence, ensuring long-term device viability and feature additions. Both generations launched with Android 14 (Pixel 9) or Android 16 (Pixel 10), with regular quarterly Pixel Drops delivering new features throughout their lifecycle.

## Connectivity and additional features show measured progress

Both generations support comprehensive connectivity including 5G (Sub-6GHz and mmWave on carrier models), Wi-Fi 6E on base Pixel 9/10 models and Wi-Fi 7 on Pro variants, Bluetooth 5.3 (Pixel 9) or 6.0 (Pixel 10), NFC for contactless payments, and USB-C 3.2. Pro models add Ultra-Wideband (UWB) for precise spatial awareness enabling features like digital car keys and accurate Find My Device location tracking. The Pixel 10 generation introduces Thread connectivity for smart home device integration.

A controversial change affects US models: the Pixel 10 adopts eSIM-only design, eliminating the physical SIM card tray. This aligns with Apple's iPhone 14 and newer models but frustrates users who value the flexibility of physical SIM cards for international travel or carrier switching. Activation can prove complicated, and the change limits user control. The Pixel 9 maintains both nano-SIM and eSIM support, offering greater flexibility.

Satellite SOS emergency communication debuts on the Pixel 9 series, providing free emergency service access for two years even without cellular coverage. This potentially life-saving feature continues on Pixel 10 models. Additional safety features include Car Crash Detection with automatic emergency calling, Emergency Location Service sharing precise GPS coordinates with first responders, and Safety Check with timed check-ins.

Both generations include stereo speakers with spatial audio support, though the Pixel 10 Pro XL receives enhanced speakers with more powerful bass. An under-display fingerprint sensor handles biometric authentication on both generations, with the Pixel 10 Pro models upgrading to ultrasonic technology for improved accuracy and speed compared to the Pixel 9's optical sensor. Neither generation retains the 3.5mm headphone jack, continuing Google's push toward wireless audio.

## Value verdict depends on timing and priorities

Determining which generation offers better value requires examining multiple factors including pricing, features, and individual usage patterns. At identical $799 list prices, the Pixel 10 clearly provides superior value for new purchasers. The addition of a telephoto camera alone justifies the purchase for photography enthusiasts, while the Tensor G5's improved thermals, larger battery, Qi2 magnetic charging, and exclusive AI features sweeten the deal. Tom's Guide declared it "the biggest upgrade in years" and "the phone most people should get." Mark Ellis Reviews called it "incredible smartphone, the best ever from Google."

However, pricing dynamics shift this calculation. As of November 2025, Pixel 9 models frequently sell at $100-350 discounts from major retailers, bringing base model prices down to $649-699. At these reduced prices, the Pixel 9 offers approximately 90% of the Pixel 10 experience for 18-25% less money. For users who rarely use telephoto zoom and don't need the absolute latest features, a discounted Pixel 9 represents exceptional value. TechRadar noted "the Pixel 9 is still the better buy" when accounting for typical street prices rather than list prices.

Current Pixel 9 owners should not upgrade to Pixel 10. The consensus among reviewers is unanimous on this point. Droid Life stated "if you own the Pixel 9, I see no need to upgrade." 9to5Google concluded "upgrading from Pixel 9 may not be exactly necessary." Android Faithful titled their review "There's no reason to upgrade!" The improvements, while real, don't justify the cost and hassle of switching devices, especially considering both phones receive seven years of software support and many Pixel 10 AI features will likely arrive on Pixel 9 through updates.

Users upgrading from Pixel 8 or older devices should choose Pixel 10. The cumulative improvements over two generations—camera enhancements, significantly better processor and thermals, larger battery, and modern connectivity—make the upgrade worthwhile. Droid Life advised such users to "upgrade as fast as you can." The seven-year update commitment ensures the Pixel 10 remains viable through 2032, providing excellent long-term value.

Gamers and performance enthusiasts should avoid both generations. The Tensor G5's performance improvements, while substantial over Tensor G4, still trail Snapdragon 8 Elite and Apple A18 Pro by 25-50% in benchmarks. Gaming performance remains mediocre with both phones defaulting to medium graphics settings. Android Police bluntly told enthusiasts to "deal with it," acknowledging these phones prioritize AI capabilities and efficiency over raw power. Users prioritizing maximum performance should consider the Samsung Galaxy S25 series with Snapdragon 8 Elite or iPhone 16 Pro with A18 Pro.

The Pro and Pro XL models follow similar value patterns. Pro models cost $999-1,099, offering superior cameras (including telephoto on Pixel 9), brighter LTPO displays, 16GB RAM, and additional features like UWB and Video Boost. The Pro XL's larger 6.8-inch display and bigger battery justify its $100-200 premium for users wanting maximum screen real estate. Pro Fold models at $1,799 target a niche audience willing to pay a premium for foldable form factors, with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold's IP68 rating and gearless hinge representing substantial durability improvements worth considering for foldable enthusiasts.

## Conclusion

The Pixel 10 advances Google's smartphone vision with focused improvements rather than revolutionary changes, making it the best value in the current Pixel lineup at $799. The addition of a telephoto camera to the base model democratizes premium photography features previously confined to Pro variants, while the TSMC-manufactured Tensor G5 addresses long-standing thermal concerns and powers genuinely useful AI capabilities. Qi2 magnetic charging, brighter displays, and larger batteries provide incremental but meaningful quality-of-life improvements. These enhancements arrive at the same price point as the Pixel 9, making the Pixel 10 an easy recommendation for anyone purchasing a new Pixel.

However, the Pixel 9 remains an excellent smartphone that will serve users well through its 2031 end-of-support date. When available at typical $100-200 discounts, it offers compelling value for budget-conscious buyers who can live without telephoto zoom and the latest AI features. Current Pixel 9 owners gain little from upgrading given the modest generational improvements and long software support runway. Performance enthusiasts seeking maximum benchmark scores or gaming capabilities should look elsewhere to Snapdragon or Apple-powered devices.

Google's strategy reveals a calculated shift: prioritizing useful AI integration and computational photography over raw performance metrics. This approach distinguishes Pixels from competitors while acknowledging that most users reached "good enough" performance years ago. The seven-year software commitment across both generations demonstrates Google's confidence in long-term device viability despite processor limitations. For buyers valuing software experience, camera quality, and AI features over benchmark numbers, both Pixel generations deliver exceptional experiences—with the Pixel 10 offering the better overall package at identical pricing.
