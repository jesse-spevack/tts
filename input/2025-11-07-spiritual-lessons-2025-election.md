# Spiritual Lessons of the 2025 Election

For anyone left of the American political center, this been the best news week in over a year. There's no denying the strength of the Democrats' showing in the elections, and there was even some encouraging news from the Supreme Court, which seems poised to stop at least some of Donald Trump's authoritarian power grabs.

It has also been a reminder, for me at least, of good old fashioned dharmic virtues like epistemic humility, impermanence, and equanimity.

True, among the hundreds or thousands of election takes written this week, I have not seen this particular angle developed. On the contrary, much of the media discourse — conservative, centrist, liberal, progressive — has continued on doing exactly what it had been doing, namely confirming priors, predicting doom (whether from Trump or Mamdani or whomever), and, in this case, pivoting seamlessly from chanting in unison that "Democrats are hopelessly lost" to chanting in unison "Democrats have found their mojo again." The herd of sheep has simply changed directions.

So here's an attempt at a different narrative, one which has the benefit of providing (at least to this writer) a useful course correction.

Really, this election result should not be surprising, because it tracks what polls have been telling us for months: that MAGA insanity is deeply unpopular not just with news junkies and leftists, but with, you know, ordinary centrist Americans who aren't on board with liberal politics but are basically decent human beings focused on kitchen-table issues and not into things like the Gulf of America or the Billionaire Ballroom.

Republicans are all on the Trump train for a variety of reasons, not least fear of retribution from Trump's friends in conservative media and billionaire-donor circles, and so everyone's been kissing in the ring. But in so doing, they have managed to do a remarkable two-step dance of self-immolation: massively overreaching on their base's pet issues, while completely failing to deliver on what voters most wanted the party to do: fix the economy.

## The Principle of Political Overreach

The election results illustrate a core principle of electoral politics: that overreach is good for the other side. To reach for an ancient 2023 example, when Ron DeSantis starting banning books and making anti-wokeness the center of his politics, I cheered, because he was way to the right even of many Republicans. Conversely, when Black Lives Matter and MeToo took extreme positions in 2020 and 2021 — 'Abolish the Police', white people are effectively born racist, there can be zero tolerance not only for sexual misconduct but for contested, debatable gray areas of male behavior — I was nervous. In the heat of it, as I was forced to attend several long DEI 'trainings' at my former place of employment, I knew that the backlash would come. And so it did.

Today, of course it is not 'good' for ICE to be throwing legal residents of this country into unmarked vans; it is horrible. But it is politically good. Ditto a lot of Project 2025. A majority of Americans do not support this agenda, and it's not why they voted Trump back into office. And ditto all of Trump's blustering nonsense, which normal people, including many who voted for him, do not like. Oh, and don't forget the Epstein Files, which as I've written about here before, may not be top of mind for progressives but is absolutely part of the picture here. Promising to unseal the names of powerful pedophiles, then backtracking because Trump is obviously one of them, is a bad look and it matters.

Probably, the GOP could get away with this overreach if they at least tried to bring down the cost of food, housing, and fuel. But they're running in the opposite direction with dumb tariffs and trickle-down economics. Polling shows that to the extent normal people (i.e. not political junkies) are aware of the 'Big Beautiful Bill', they hate it. The summary assessment of it as "tax breaks for billionaires while taking away food stamps and health insurance" is sticking, it is accurate, and it is a loser for the Right.

## Relearning Political Equanimity

On a personal, spiritual, psychological level, I need to relearn the value of political equanimity. Despite its connotations, equanimity — at least in the Buddhist sources that undergird my contemplative practice — doesn't mean one doesn't feel emotions like moral disgust, fear, and anger. It means that one can acknowledge them while retaining the ability to sit back and assume a posture of noticing, observing, and remembering rather than merely reacting. For example, Trump's destruction of USAID is both a humanitarian catastrophe and a political miscalculation that will likely have "positive" political consequences. The National Guard on the streets of American cities is a blow against the democratic order and, most likely, an overreach that is not where American public opinion is.

If you've been reading this newsletter, obviously you know that I'm not sanguine in the face of these depredations. Protest is important, trying to break through right-wing media walls is important, and voting is very important. Passion and equanimity are both of value. But if I reflect on my "bad days" from 2025, they are when the scale tipped too much toward doomsaying, certainty, and panic. This week's news might, I hope, bring a reminder of the value of having both a cooler head and an impassioned heart.

In practice, this may look like oscillation between the two — I didn't expect this essay on "oscillation as spiritual practice" to be my touchstone this year, but it has turned out to be that. That's fine. We have moments of immersion and moments of constructive detachment. Or it might look like balance, complex seeing, and multivalence; holding multiple realities at the same moment. How does it look like for you?
